# BMC Lab - Research

## Overview
As a Research Intern at the BMC Lab, I have been deeply involved in enhancing and developing tools that help in the analysis and detection of cancer cells through advanced microscopy techniques. Collaborating with renowned researchers, I have worked on improving the microscopy pipeline and the accuracy of cancer detection algorithms.

## Key Contributions
- Leveraged various Python libraries such as PyQt5, OpenCV, PySide6, and Pandas, building tools for better image processing and analysis.
- Focused on enhancing the detection process using Brillouin microscopy, aiming to make the process faster and more reliable.
- Contributed to the development of algorithms and user interface improvements for real-time image acquisition and analysis.
